\# Deep Learning Learning Journey 



This repository documents my \*\*learning journey in Deep Learning\*\*, starting from the fundamentals and gradually moving toward more advanced concepts.



Currently, it includes:

\- Perceptron learning algorithm (from scratch)

\- Perceptron loss and decision boundary visualization

\- Basic experiments using NumPy and Python



This repository is \*\*actively evolving\*\*. As I progress, I will keep adding:

\- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

\- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

\- Training techniques, loss functions, and optimization methods

\- More datasets, experiments, and visualizations



The goal of this repository is to build a \*\*strong conceptual foundation\*\* and maintain a clear record of my hands-on learning.
